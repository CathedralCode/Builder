# CHANGELOG

Basically a todo of things i would like to maybe do,

once done the move to history and there is my change log :)

## TODO

BuilderManager

-   Some more convenience methods, like write [file(s) for table(s)|all]
    just simper

Add documentation to the code

When checking if a file already exists, have it check the version for
existing files.

Better checking and feed back if requirements like write access, etc...
